# Place all files you want to push inside this directory
# - they will be pushed 1:1 so they have to have .conf ending 
#   so splunk recognizes them
#
#
# Hint:
# Whenever you deploy ansible managed files from the ansible server to a target
# a phrase will be added to the top of each conf file:
#
# ########## ANSIBLE FILE-MANAGED - DO NOT TOUCH WITHOUT ANSIBLE (some info) ##########
#
# If using now or later the "remove_absent_files" feature ansible will check 
# for this exact phrase to find out which files are managed and which not!
# 
# remove_absent_files - feature:
#     When you set the "remove_absent_files = true" in the config file all files without
#     the above phrase will be RENAMED (to $file-unmanaged).
#     Exact phrase = "^#+\sAnSiBLe\sFiLE-MANaGeD"
# 	- whole phrase is case insensitive (e.g.: ansible or ANSIBLE or AnSIbLE will all match)
# 	- "^#+" => search for "#" at the beginning of a line
# 	- "\s" 	=> 1 white space (no TAB! and not more then 1)
# 	- the full file! will be checked for this phrase (no need to have it on top but its recommended)
#
# Changes made in the GUI:
#     When you have made changes within the GUI you have to ensure that you
#     copy the changed files to your ansible server and place them in the 
#     corresponded directory. If you forget to copy them over and you run ansible the
#     next time they get overwritten!
